// to run 
 javac -classpath "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21\bin\mysql-connector-j-8.2.0.jar" Database.java Main.java
 java -classpath ".;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21\bin\mysql-connector-j-8.2.0.jar" Main


 if you encounter an error like this
 {
    Data truncation: Out of range value for column 'HOME_EXPENSES' at row 1
 com.mysql.cj.jdbc.exceptions.MysqlDataTruncation: Data truncation: Out of range value for column 'HOME_EXPENSES' at row 1
 }
 then you need to run this command in your mysql database
 {
   ALTER TABLE BUDGET_PLANS MODIFY COLUMN HOME_EXPENSES DECIMAL(8,2);

 }
idk what is the problem but this seems to fix it so lets use this for now 
try if we can integrate this with the existing code to make it functional
